# PY-CL-Tuples

## Overview

This project demonstrates various operations on tuples in Python. It includes functions to create tuples, access elements, concatenate tuples, repeat tuples, check membership, perform tuple slicing, count occurrences of items, and find the index of items in tuples. The project also includes an entry point script `(app.py)` to interactively demonstrate the functionality.

## Files

### app.py

The `app.py` file serves as the main entry point for the project. It allows users to interactively test the tuple manipulation functions implemented in `lab.py`. Users can create tuples, access elements, and perform other tuple operations through this script.

### lab.py

The `lab.py` file contains the implementations of various tuple manipulation functions. Each function is documented with instructions on how to use it and what it does. The functions include creating tuples, accessing elements, concatenating tuples, repeating tuples, checking membership, tuple slicing, counting occurrences, and finding index.

## Getting Started

- Open the `src/main/app.py` file.
- Run the `app.py` file to interactively test the tuple manipulation functions.
- Follow the prompts to create tuples, access elements, and perform other tuple operations.
- Refer to the instructions provided in the docstrings of each function in `lab.py` for guidance on usage.

## Testing

Testing for the project is not explicitly provided, but users can test the functions by running the app.py script and verifying the outputs for different input scenarios.

## Conclusion

This project provides hands-on experience with tuple manipulation in Python. By exploring the functions in `lab.py` and running the tests through app.py, users can enhance their understanding of tuples and improve their Python programming skills.

Happy Coding!
